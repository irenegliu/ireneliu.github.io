## Projects

- **[Multimodal Depression Detection via Speech Recognition]**: Currently developing an advanced multimodal depression detection framework using Bayesian multimodal fusion. The model integrates speech embeddings extracted from Facebook AI's Wav2Vec 2.0, capturing multi-layer acoustic, phonetic, and semantic features, with EEG-based neural activity features derived via Bayesian Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Bayesian Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Utilizing a Bayesian Cross-Modal Attention mechanism, EEG and speech features are aligned effectively in a shared latent representation. The final depression classification employs a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) to quantify uncertainty in predictions, enhancing clinical interpretability and decision-making confidence. Systematic preprocessing ensures high-quality input data by performing extensive EEG signal processing (band-pass filtering, artifact removal, normalization, segmentation) and speech signal normalization (resampling, mono conversion, silence trimming). The project leverages open-source multimodal datasets comprising EEG recordings and speech samples labeled by emotional states, crucial for robust depression analysis. This ongoing research aims to achieve superior accuracy and reliability compared to unimodal models, providing an uncertainty-aware diagnostic tool suitable for clinical depression screening, affective computing, and mental health diagnostics.
