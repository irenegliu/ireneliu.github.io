## Projects

- **[Multimodal Depression Detection via Speech Recognition]**: Enhancing clinical decision-making and mental health diagnostics by developing an AI-driven depression detection framework that quantifies uncertainty for more confident diagnoses. This solution integrates speech embeddings from Facebook AI’s Wav2Vec 2.0 and EEG-based neural activity features using Bayesian Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). A Bayesian Cross-Modal Attention mechanism aligns these modalities, while a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) ensures reliable classification. Robust preprocessing of EEG and speech data ensures high-quality input, making this model a scalable tool for clinical screening, affective computing, and early mental health intervention.
